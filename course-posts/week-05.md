This week, we'll talk about the following:

- for an ideal $I$ of a ring $R$, the quotient group $R/I$ has the structure of a ring

- after that, the goal for the week will be to introduce analogues of
  basic notions from linear algebra, but where the scalars are taken
  from an arbitrary commutative ring

- the notion of a /category/, and explain why initial and terminal
  objects in a category are unique
- the notion of a product and a co-product in a category
- the notion of a module over a commutative ring
- the notion of the direct sum of modules (a co-product in the
  category of modules).
- the notion of a free module, meaning module with a basis.

- [problem set 5] will be posted Tuesday.
