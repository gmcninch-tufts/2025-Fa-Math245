title   : Week 3

This week, we will discuss the quotient group $G/N$ when $N$ is a
normal subgroup, and we'll discuss $p$-groups and Sylow's Theorem. (I
hope to prove Sylow's Theorem this week, but I may still discuss
applications of it next week. So there shouldg be more problems about
Sylow in problem set 4).
