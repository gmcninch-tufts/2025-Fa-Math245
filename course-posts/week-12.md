This week, I'll finish our discussion of local rings and the Nakayama
Lemma, and then I'll start talking about the classification of
finitely generated modules over a PID.

I'm going to go ahead and post the next homework assignment (due
sometime after thanksgiving). (I've tried to name homework assignments
after the week they are due, though I think I messed up with
PS11. Anyhow, there won't be a PS12).
