During the course, students will be asked to submit solutions to
*problem sets*.  These submissions will be made via the online
resource [gradescope]; your work will be read/marked by a course
grader, and it will then be returned, again via [gradescope].

Make sure that when you log in to [gradescope], you use the *school
credentials* option. You should select *Tufts University* from the
menu of choices, and you'll then be able to login with your
**UTLN**. The roster on [gradescope] has already been populated using
the roster on [canvas].

Note that each submission to [gradescope] must be made in the form of
a *single* `PDF` file. If one plans to submit handwritten work, all
pages of the work must be scanned to a single PDF file, first.  *Make
sure to get a high-quality scan*.

More information about student submissions to gradescope is
[available

particular, you can find information/advice about getting a good scan
